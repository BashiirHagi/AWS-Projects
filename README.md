# AWS-Projects:  

Hands on AWS Labs to enhance understanding of key AWS services: S3, VPC's, RDS, IAM, RDS, ECS, API Gateway's. 

  

### Simple Storage Service - S3 : 


#### AWS task to create a S3 bucket & change the bucket policy to public   

  

Navigate to the us-east-1 (N.Virginia) region on the AWS console 

  

Click on S3 under Storage services 

  

Create a S3 bucket with a valid bucket name - e.g. myS3bucket-test 

  

#### Upload 2 separate object files to the S3 bucket via the AWS console  

Create bucket > Upload > Add files > Select file from local machine  

  

  

  

#### Change S3 bucket policy to public:  

  

Modify bucket permission to make the S3 bucket files publicly accessible   

  

Paste the below bucket policy under Permmissions > Bucket policy  

``` 

{ 

    "Version": "2012-10-17", 

    "Id": "Policy1635321416121", 

    "Statement": [ 

        { 

            "Sid": "Stmt1635321403959", 

            "Effect": "Allow", 

            "Principal": "*", 

            "Action": "s3:GetObject", 

            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::myS3bucket-test/*" 

        } 

    ] 

} 

  
``` 

  

Enter the bucket URL on the browser and the object files are now publicly accessible  


All future S3 file uploads will become public now  

  
  

### Creating and Subscribing to SNS Topics, Adding SNS events to S3 buckets 

#### AWS task to create a SNS topic and subscribing to a S3 bucket event 

  
#### create the SNS topic 
Navigate to the us-east-1 (N.Virginia) region on the AWS console

Create a S3 bucket - mytestbucket 

Object ownership: Select ACLs disabled 

Keep other settings as default

Click Create bucket

Save and make a copy of the Amazon Resource Name (ARN)


#### Update the SNS topic Access Ppolicy: 

Navigate to the SNS service

Click on Topics in the left-hand panel

Click on the existing SNS topic

Click Edit > Access Policy 

Enter the SNS topic ARN in the resource section below 

Enter the S3 bucket ARN in the condition section below


``` 

{
  "Version": "2008-10-17",
  "Id": "__default_policy_ID",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "__default_statement_ID",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "*"
      },
      "Action": [
        "SNS:GetTopicAttributes",
        "SNS:SetTopicAttributes",
        "SNS:AddPermission",
        "SNS:RemovePermission",
        "SNS:DeleteTopic",
        "SNS:Subscribe",
        "SNS:ListSubscriptionsByTopic",
        "SNS:Publish",
        "SNS:Receive"
      ],
      "Resource": "<Your_SNS_Topic_ARN>",
      "Condition": {
        "ArnLike": {
          "aws:SourceArn": "<Your_Bucket_ARN>"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}

``` 

Click Save changes
