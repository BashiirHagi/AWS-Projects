# AWS-Projects: 
Hands on AWS Labs to enhance understanding of key AWS services: S3, VPC's, RDS, IAM, RDS, ECS, API Gateway

## Simple Storage Service - S3 :

AWS task to create S3 bucket & change bucket policy to public  

I clicked on S3 under Storage services

I created an S3 bucket in the us-east-1 (N.Virgina) region with a valid bucket name

I uploaded 2 separate object files to the S3 bucket via the AWS console  

I modified object permission to make the S3 bucket publicly accessible  

Changed bucket policy to: 

```
{ 
   "Id": "Policy1", 
   "Version": "2012-10-17", 
   "Statement": [ 
      { 
         "Sid": "Stmt1", 
         "Action": [ 
            "s3:GetObject" 
         ], 
         "Effect": "Allow", 
         "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::mys3bucket-test 

/*", 
         "Principal": "*" 
      } 
   ] 
} 
```

I entered the bucket URL on the browser and the object files were now accessible


### Creating and Subscribing to SNS Topics, Adding SNS events to S3 bucket

I created a SNS topic by clicking on SNS > choosing standard topic and clicking on Create topic  

I created a S3 bucket  

I subscribed the S3 bucket to the SNS topic and chose my email as the endpoint â€“ bashiir_20@hotmail.co.uk  

I then made an image upload to the S3 bucket triggering the SNS topic  

I received a notification via email about the S3 upload action


## Accessing an S3 bucket with an IAM role

I provisioned an EC2 isntance and attached the S3FullAccess IAM policy to it

I congiured the security group inound rules allowed SSH traffic to the instance


### key commands:

chmod 400 S3keys.pem - to make SSH private key secure  

ssh -i S3keys.pem ec2-user@54.236.213.214 - to SSH into EC2 instance  

aws s3 ls - to list the S3 bucket  

Touch AWS.txt - to create text (.txt) file  

aws s3 mv AWS.txt s3://test-bucket - to move the text file to the S3 bucket


## Relational Database Service (RDS)

I clicked on Databases and then Relational Database services (RDS)

I provisioned a RDS MySQL database providing details such as name, login credentials, instance class and storage type 

I then installed MYSQL workbench on my local machine to use to connect to my cloud server 

I connected to the RDS database on AWS by using the DNS address and port no (3306) of the instance. 

I used the username and password configured during the database setup 

Successful connection was established to the RDS database


## Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) - public and private subnets

I created a VPC under Network & Content delivery services  

I then created a public and private subnet inside the VPC and assigned a IP address to them. 

I assigned the subnets to the VPC network 

I then created the internet gateway and attached it to the VPC

I then created a route table and connected the private and public subnets to it  

I added a route on the route table to allow traffic to the internet gateway (IGW) with target 0.0.0.0/0. Instances in the public and private subnet will be able to connect to the internet now.
